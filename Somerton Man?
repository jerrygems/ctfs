firstly i just downloaded the file that was named as "challenge.txt"
then i got redirected to another page, 
In which i found some encrypted texts
texts : "Purpx bhg Nhfgenyvn'f Fbzregba Zna jura lbh trg gvzr... Naljnlf, guvf vf lbhe synt: uneqrfgpvcurevauvfgbel." .
just becoz i played a lot of ctfs i figured out by my practices that these ciphertexts were encrypted by ROT13 algorithm.
i just used some online tools to decrypt these cipher texts.
and after decrypting these cipher texts i got some texts :"Check out Australia's Somerton Man when you get time... Anyways, this is your flag: hardestcipherinhistory."
and found the flag that was flag{hardest_cipher_in_history}
